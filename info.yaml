# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      This project implements the VGA protocol and allows custom images to be displayed to the screen.

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
